Using a novel approach of vacuum oven isolation in nitrogen-free media with maltose and a specialized 90-mineral salt mix, we isolated and cultured the cyanobacteria under controlled conditions. A dark bioreactor setup with maltose as a substrate with a short-path distiller was employed to cultivate the cyanobacteria. The experimental results demonstrate that the bioreactor generated a pressure differential ranging from -28 inHg to 0 inHg, within a 6 to 12-hour timeframe, per gallon of maltose, depending on distillation efficiency. This research presents a promising avenue for the use of Nostoc cyanobacteria in bioreactor systems and microbial fuel cell applications. test 1\nIsolation bacteria inside cyanobateria 1. Introduction # Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are versatile microorganisms with numerous applications in biotechnology, including biofuel production, bioremediation, and carbon sequestration. Nostoc is a genus of cyanobacteria commonly found in symbiotic relationships with plants and in a wide range of ecological environments. Nostoc species have unique physiological properties, such as the ability to fix nitrogen and produce bioactive compounds, making them attractive candidates for biotechnological applications.\nThis project focuses on isolating and culturing cyanobacteria from Nostoc algae found in the wild grasses of Colorado. Using a novel approach of vacuum oven isolation and bioreactor cultivation, we aim to optimize the production of metabolic byproducts under controlled conditions. Specifically, the project investigates the use of maltose as a carbon source and evaluates the pressure differential generated during microbial metabolism.\n2. Objectives # Isolate Nostoc cyanobacteria from wild grass samples collected in Colorado. Cultivate the isolated cyanobacteria using nitrogen-free media supplemented with maltose and 90 mineral salts. Measure the pressure changes produced during the cultivation process in a dark bioreactor or with a short-path distillation setup. Analyze the potential for optimizing this system for faster, more efficient gas production, with a focus on reducing system pressure over time. Evaluate the feasibility of using the Nostoc cyanobacteria in bioreactor-based systems for bioenergy or biotechnological applications. 3. Materials and Methods # 3.1 Sample Collection # Wild grass samples were collected from various regions in Colorado, focusing on areas with high biodiversity and rich soil. Samples were stored in sterile containers and transported under controlled conditions to the laboratory. 3.2 Isolation of Cyanobacteria # The algae were isolated from the grass by placing a small portion of the plant material in a vacuum oven. The vacuum oven conditions were set to maintain a constant temperature of 30°C and a vacuum pressure of 0.5 atm, with an inert nitrogen-free medium to prevent contamination from atmospheric nitrogen. The isolation media consisted of: Nitrogen-free mineral salts (90 salts) 1% maltose as the carbon source Distilled water The system was maintained under these conditions for a period of 3 months to encourage growth while preventing contamination by external microorganisms.\n3.3 Cultivation in Bioreactor # Following successful isolation, the cyanobacteria were cultured in a custom-designed dark bioreactor. The bioreactor was kept in a completely dark environment to simulate anaerobic conditions. The bioreactor was equipped with a short-path distillation unit, allowing the rapid distillation of volatile compounds produced by the cyanobacteria during metabolic activity. Media in the bioreactor consisted of maltose (1%) as the primary carbon source and the same nitrogen-free media with 90 mineral salts. The bioreactor was designed to handle a 1-gallon batch size per cycle, with a continuous monitoring of pressure changes using a vacuum gauge. 3.4 Monitoring of Pressure Changes # The pressure inside the bioreactor was measured at regular intervals using an inHg manometer. Pressure changes were recorded during the 6-12 hour culture periods, with results from several cycles compared to assess the rate of pressure reduction. Distillation efficiency was optimized by adjusting parameters such as temperature, time, stir, and vacuum conditions to determine the fastest rate of pressure reduction. 4. Results # The bioreactor system generated a pressure differential ranging from -28 inHg to 0 inHg over a 6 to 12-hour period per gallon of maltose, depending on the distillation conditions. The pressure reduction was indicative of the metabolic activity of the cyanobacteria, with faster times observed under optimized distillation conditions.\n4.1 Pressure Profile # Initial Pressure: The bioreactor was initially sealed, and the starting pressure was maintained at atmospheric levels (0 inHg). Pressure Drop Start: Vaccumed to -28 hg and stirriing begins. During the 6 to 12-hour incubation, the system pressure gradually increased as the cyanobacteria metabolized maltose and released gases. Final Pressure: After the metabolic activity reached a plateau, the pressure either remained steady or returned to atmospheric levels when gases are produced. Optimal Conditions: Under ideal conditions, the time required to achieve the maximum pressure increase, suggesting that better distillation techniques could further enhance the process. 4.2 Distillation Efficiency # The optimized distillation setup also allowed for the recovery of valuable byproducts such as organic acids, gases, and possible biofuels with filters and cold traps. 5. Discussion # The isolation of Nostoc cyanobacteria from Colorado wild grasses and their cultivation in a controlled dark bioreactor environment demonstrated a promising approach for microbial metabolism-driven pressure generation. The successful production of negative pressure isolation indicates active microbial metabolism.\nThe pressure profiles observed can be further optimized by refining the distillation parameters to reduce the time required for gas production, which has implications for applications in bioenergy generation, microbial fuel cells, nitrogen fixing bacteria and bioreactor-based systems.\nFuture studies should explore:\nThe genetic characteristics of the isolated Nostoc strains to determine their metabolic pathways and stress tolerance. The scalability of this system for larger bioreactor setups. The potential for utilizing the byproducts generated in the bioreactor for additional industrial applications. 6. Conclusion # This project successfully isolated and cultivated Nostoc cyanobacteria from wild grasses in Colorado and demonstrated their potential in bioreactor systems for generating metabolic byproducts and positive pressure. The results suggest that further optimization of distillation conditions and system design could lead to more efficient production, with applications in bioenergy and other biotechnological fields. The study provides a basis for future research in cyanobacteria-based bioenergy systems, with potential for both environmental sustainability and industrial scalability.\n7.

Algae, especially cyanobacteria, have played an essential role in shaping the environment, from the soil structure to the colors we associate with plant pigments. The concept of \u0026ldquo;Teaming with Algae\u0026rdquo; opens an avenue to explore how these organisms interact with plants, focusing on the rhizophagy cycle, the role of pigments, and the symbiotic relationship between cyanobacteria and algae in improving soil structure.\nIn this book, we’ll explore the delicate relationship between algae, plants, and the soil. We’ll examine how algae contribute to plant health through their pigments and the rhizophagy cycle, while highlighting how cyanobacteria influence soil fertility and structure.\nChapter 1: The Rhizophagy Cycle - A Symbiotic Dance Between Roots and Algae # The rhizophagy cycle refers to the process where plant roots actively interact with microbes, such as algae, to exchange nutrients. This cycle is vital for plant health, as it creates a dynamic feedback loop where algae break down organic material in the soil and convert it into nutrients that plants can absorb.\nHow It Works:\nPlant roots release compounds into the soil, which attract algae and other microorganisms. Algae and rhizobacteria absorb these compounds and convert them into essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In return, plants absorb these nutrients, improving their growth. Algae, particularly cyanobacteria, play a pivotal role in this nutrient exchange, acting as natural fertilizers. By forming a symbiotic relationship with plant roots, algae facilitate nutrient cycling, ensuring the plants thrive in a balanced ecosystem.\nReferences:\nAroca, R., et al. (2012). \u0026ldquo;Algal contributions to rhizosphere processes.\u0026rdquo; Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 44(1), 3-10. Chapter 2: Pigment Colors in Plants and Their Relationship with Algae # Pigment color is one of the most striking features of plants, and algae play a significant role in the development of these pigments. The primary pigments in plants are chlorophylls, carotenoids, and anthocyanins. Interestingly, algae are rich in pigments that are directly involved in the photosynthetic processes of plants.\nHow Algae Affect Pigment Development:\nAlgae contribute chlorophyll to plants, especially during early stages of growth. The presence of cyanobacteria in the rhizophagy cycle can also influence pigment production by stimulating the plant\u0026rsquo;s photosynthetic apparatus. The color dynamics in plants can also be affected by environmental factors, such as the presence of specific algae and their pigments like phycocyanin, which can influence the color spectrum of plants.

These bacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are nitrogen fixers and produce organic compounds that significantly enhance soil fertility.\nThe Role of Cyanobacteria in the Soil:\nCyanobacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form plants can use, which helps sustain plant growth in nitrogen-poor soils. They produce extracellular polysaccharides that bind soil particles, contributing to the formation of soil aggregates. These aggregates improve soil structure, water retention, and root penetration. Cyanobacteria’s interaction with algae in the rhizophagy cycle further enhances nutrient cycling, ensuring that plants receive the necessary elements for robust growth. References: 3. Stal, L. J., \u0026amp; Elbrächter, M. (2011). \u0026ldquo;Cyanobacteria and soil fertility.\u0026rdquo; Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 43(1), 12-18.\nChapter 4: Soil Structure and the Role of Algae and Cyanobacteria # Soil health is crucial for plant survival, and algae and cyanobacteria play a foundational role in soil structure. Cyanobacteria, in particular, are involved in both the stabilization and the regeneration of soil aggregates, improving aeration, drainage, and nutrient availability.\nThe Impact on Soil Structure:\nCyanobacteria form biofilms on soil surfaces, which help in preventing soil erosion and improving water retention. By enhancing soil aggregation, cyanobacteria make it easier for plant roots to penetrate the soil, allowing for better nutrient uptake. In arid and nutrient-deficient soils, cyanobacteria and algae work together to create an environment that supports plant life by increasing the soil\u0026rsquo;s ability to hold water and nutrients.

(2008). \u0026ldquo;Soil health and biodiversity in agroecosystems.\u0026rdquo; Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 40(8), 2089-2099.\nChapter 5: The Algal Microbiome: Influences on Soil and Plant Health # Algae are not isolated players in the ecosystem; they are part of a broader microbial community that works together to maintain soil and plant health. The algal microbiome includes not only cyanobacteria but also other microorganisms that interact with algae and plants.\nMicrobiome Dynamics:\nAlgae, through their root interactions, influence the composition of soil microbiomes, including fungi and bacteria. The diversity of microorganisms in the rhizophagy cycle helps create a balanced soil environment that supports plant health. Algae\u0026rsquo;s role in improving soil structure through microbial interactions further emphasizes the importance of a healthy microbiome for sustainable agriculture. References: 5. Berendsen, R. L., et al. (2012). \u0026ldquo;The rhizosphere microbiome: The soil-root interface.\u0026rdquo; Nature Reviews Microbiology, 10(12), 717-728.\nConclusion: Harnessing the Power of Algae for Sustainable Agriculture # Algae, particularly cyanobacteria, are key players in maintaining soil health, improving plant growth, and influencing pigment production. Through the rhizophagy cycle, algae facilitate nutrient cycling between plants and soil microbes, enhancing soil structure and fertility. The symbiotic relationships that algae form with plants go beyond mere nutrient exchange and extend into the realms of pigment production and soil stabilization.\nUnderstanding these interactions is crucial for sustainable agriculture, as we look for ways to improve soil health, reduce chemical inputs, and promote biodiversity. By teaming with algae, we can develop more resilient, productive, and sustainable farming practices that benefit both the environment and the crops we rely on.\nReferences:\nAroca, R., et al.

The idea came to its founder, Brady Price, after years of frustration with the conventional farming methods that dominated the industry. Brady had always been fascinated by the intricate designs of nature, how everything from trees to coastlines seemed to follow fractal patterns—repeating, self-similar structures that worked in harmony. He realized that if he could replicate this fractal wisdom in farming, it could transform the way food was grown, forever.\nFractal Growth wasn’t just another organic farm. It was a living system built to mimic nature\u0026rsquo;s perfect balance. At the heart of it were fractals—those self-repeating patterns found in everything from the smallest leaf to the largest mountain range. These fractals weren’t just abstract concepts. Brady’s idea was simple yet groundbreaking: what if every nutrient, every element used in farming, could be structured like a fractal? What if the soil and the plants could work together in a harmonious cycle of growth, feeding each other perfectly?\nEach nutrient—whether nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, or trace minerals—was not just added to the soil in its basic form but was carefully structured to mimic the fractal patterns naturally found in the earth and in the plants themselves. This fractal structuring allowed the nutrients to be absorbed more effectively, making it easier for plants to take them up when they needed them the most. The soil, teeming with microbial life, became an ecosystem that was far more resilient and productive than traditional methods could achieve.\nUnlike chemical fertilizers, which often caused imbalances in the soil and stressed plants, the fractal nutrients created a self-regulating system. Brady also incorporated natural, organic ferments and bison compost into his system. Organic ferments, made by breaking down plant material with beneficial microbes, created a steady supply of nutrients that could be taken up by the plants slowly and steadily. The bison compost, rich in organic matter, provided even more nutrients as it decomposed, and its slow-release nature allowed plants to access what they needed over time without overwhelming the soil’s natural processes.\nThe key was in the design. Brady believed that using plant material back on itself—recycling it within the system—created the perfect conditions for nutrient uptake. The soil didn’t just receive nutrients from outside sources; it became a self-sustaining, regenerative ecosystem. The microbes, fungi, and organic matter worked in a delicate balance, constantly enriching the soil and providing plants with everything they needed to thrive.\nBison compost, in particular, was one of Brady’s most prized ingredients. The slow decomposition process of the compost, full of microorganisms, helped restore soil biodiversity. The rich mix of organic material kept the soil healthy and fertile without needing any chemical additives. The plants, in turn, grew stronger and more resilient, their roots delving deep into the nutrient-rich soil.\nAs for the ferments, Brady would ferment plant material like comfrey, nettles, and alfalfa, breaking them down with beneficial microbes into a powerful, nutrient-dense liquid. This organic ferment not only provided essential minerals and vitamins but also improved the soil’s health by encouraging the growth of beneficial microbes that helped plants fend off pests and disease.\nOver time, the results were undeniable. Crops at Fractal Growth flourished in ways that amazed even the most experienced farmers. The soil was rich, dark, and full of life. There were no synthetic pesticides or herbicides, because the balanced ecosystem naturally kept pests in check and promoted healthy growth. The plants thrived in an environment where everything was connected, working in harmony.\nCustomers who tasted Fractal Growth’s produce were blown away. The vegetables were more vibrant, the fruits sweeter, and the flavors more intense than anything they had ever tasted. The food was not only better for you—it was a testament to what was possible when farming aligned itself with nature’s perfect designs.\nAs word spread, Fractal Growth became a beacon of hope for farmers looking for a better way. Brady’s system showed that farming didn’t have to rely on chemicals or synthetic fertilizers. Instead, it could be a partnership between plants, soil, microbes, and humans, one that promoted sustainability and regeneration.\nSoon, Brady found himself traveling the country, speaking at conferences and sharing his findings. He encouraged farmers to make the shift to organic methods, explaining how fractal farming could restore the health of their land while increasing productivity. He was not just offering a new way to farm; he was offering a new way to think about farming—one that mirrored the wisdom of nature itself.\nFractal Growth became more than a business. It became a movement, a symbol of what could be achieved when we stop working against nature and start working with it. Brady Price’s vision was clear: By using plant material back on itself, farming could be infinitely regenerative—growing stronger with every season. And through Fractal Growth, the world would see that farming could be both a science and an art, a perfect cycle of balance and abundance.\n","date":"1 January 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/fractal_growth/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Fractal Growth","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hemp-dream-catcher/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hemp Dream Catcher","type":"tags"},{"content":"The start of the dream catcher\nUse full plant and fold when wet ","date":"1 January 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/howto/how_to_make_hemp_dream_catcher/","section":"How To","summary":"","title":"How to make a hemp dream catcher","type":"howto"},{"content":"","date":"20 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cannabis-scanner/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cannabis Scanner","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/dg/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"DG","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/dinaminica-generale/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dinaminica Generale","type":"tags"},{"content":"Joining Forces with Dinaminica Generale: Revolutionizing Cannabis Agriculture with Precision Technology\nMy journey into joining Dinaminica Generale, an Italian-based precision agricultural company, was not something I could have predicted, but it has been a transformative partnership that will forever change the way we approach cannabis farming. Known for its cutting-edge technology, especially the NIR (Near Infrared) scanner designed for nutrient-on-demand output, Dinaminica Generale specializes in optimizing crop yields with high-precision technology. The partnership started in an unexpected way: when their CEO toured my farm, we began a conversation that would lead to one of the most innovative collaborations in the cannabis industry. What started as a simple discussion about technology, crops, and agriculture would eventually grow into a partnership aimed at revolutionizing cannabis cultivation, from nutrient management to cannabinoid testing and beyond. The Initial Encounter: A Meeting of Minds # It all began when the CEO of Dinaminica Generale, a leader in agricultural precision technology, visited my farm. I had been using various methods to improve the efficiency of my farming practices, and we were already achieving high yields. However, as the demand for quality cannabis products continued to rise, I was looking for ways to fine-tune the growing process and further enhance the precision of nutrient delivery to each plant. During his visit, the CEO took a tour of my farm, and we began to discuss the possibilities of applying advanced agricultural technology to cannabis cultivation.\nThe conversation quickly turned to the potential of Dinaminica’s NIR (Near Infrared) scanner, which had already proven successful in a variety of other agricultural sectors. The scanner is capable of analyzing the nutrient levels of crops in real time, providing farmers with on-demand data to optimize nutrient management. We talked about the ability to monitor crops’ health, detect nutrient deficiencies, and ensure precision feeding in a way that could revolutionize the way we grow cannabis.\nAt that moment, the idea sparked: Could this technology be adapted to test not just the nutrients in crops but also the cannabinoid profiles in cannabis plants? Could the NIR scanner detect subtle changes in cannabinoid levels, allowing for more precise control of the growing process? The CEO was intrigued by the possibility, but it was clear that it would require further testing and collaboration.\nThe Trip to Italy: Testing the Technology # The idea of integrating Dinaminica’s NIR scanner into the cannabis growing process stayed with me, and soon, I found myself traveling to Italy to meet with their team. The goal was clear: I needed to understand whether the technology could be adapted to read cannabinoids, and if so, how it could be programmed to deliver precise results that would support my growing methods.\nUpon arriving at their headquarters, I was introduced to a team of experts, including their head mathematician, who would play a pivotal role in determining the potential for adapting the scanner to cannabis. We discussed the technicalities of the NIR system and its capabilities, focusing on how the machine reads the spectra of light reflected off plant materials to identify nutrients and compounds.\nAfter a series of in-depth conversations and analysis, the head mathematician offered a cautious but optimistic response: “Maybe.” His assessment reflected the complexity of working with cannabis, a plant known for its unique composition and variability in cannabinoid profiles. While the NIR scanner had been proven to work in other crops, cannabis presented a unique challenge due to its complex cannabinoid content, which includes various compounds like THC, CBD, and a host of other lesser-known cannabinoids. However, the mathematician was open to experimenting and working together to find a solution.\nWith that response, the wheels were set in motion. Dinaminica Generale and I agreed to collaborate on this exciting venture, and I returned to Colorado with a renewed sense of purpose. The goal was to see if we could program the AgriNIR machine to match lab results for cannabinoids and create a tool that could help farmers like me manage not just nutrients but also cannabinoid profiles in real time.\nBack to Colorado: Programming the AgriNIR Machine # Once back in Colorado, the real work began. I started by gathering data from my own cannabis plants, focusing on correlating the NIR scan results with lab results for cannabinoids. This process was intensive, requiring extensive testing across a wide range of cannabinoid levels in different cannabis strains. Every variable was taken into account: environmental conditions, growth stages, and cultivation practices, all of which affect cannabinoid production.\nI worked closely with Dinaminica’s team to program the AgriNIR machine, a state-of-the-art tool that would eventually be able to scan large batches of cannabis plants in a matter of seconds, providing farmers with detailed data on cannabinoid content. By cross-referencing the spectral data from the NIR scanner with the lab results, we were able to create a database that allowed the machine to “learn” from the samples. This AI-driven system began to improve its accuracy over time, and what started as an error margin of around 2% in the results gradually shrank as the system was trained.\nThrough iterative testing, we refined the system, allowing the AgriNIR machine to give an overall snapshot of cannabinoid levels across large samples, making it possible to quickly assess the quality and potency of cannabis crops without the need for expensive, time-consuming lab tests. As the machine continued to learn and adjust, its precision improved, offering an increasingly reliable tool for cannabis farmers who wanted to make data-driven decisions about their crops.\nThe Benefits: A Complete Precision Farming Circle for Cannabis # The AgriNIR machine’s ability to scan large samples quickly and efficiently is only one aspect of its value. This precision technology has the potential to change the landscape of cannabis agriculture in a number of ways. One of the most immediate benefits is its ability to give a real-time overview of cannabinoid profiles across a field or greenhouse. This makes it easier to identify plants that may be underperforming or those that are producing higher-than-expected yields. By using the NIR machine to monitor cannabinoid levels throughout the growth cycle, farmers can adjust their growing practices and inputs to maximize both yield and potency.\nIn addition to this, the AgriNIR machine can also be used to monitor other key factors in cannabis farming, including nutrient levels, water usage, and plant health. It integrates perfectly with other precision farming technologies, creating a seamless approach to agriculture that combines data analysis with on-the-ground action. Whether it’s adjusting nutrient delivery systems, optimizing irrigation schedules, or fine-tuning the growing environment, the AgriNIR machine provides cannabis farmers with the insights they need to make smarter, more informed decisions.\nAnother exciting application for the AgriNIR machine is its potential to assist in border control for interstate cannabis shipments. Because the machine provides accurate, on-demand testing for cannabinoid content, it can be used to verify the potency and legality of cannabis products before they cross state lines. In a time when the cannabis industry is still navigating complex and varying legal landscapes, this ability to verify product quality quickly and efficiently can help ensure compliance with local and federal regulations.\nBeyond cannabinoid testing, the AgriNIR technology also offers applications for hemp farming, including fiber and seed production. Using the combine header on-demand scanner, the machine can analyze hemp crops for fiber quality and seed characteristics, allowing farmers to optimize their production for both industrial and agricultural use. This makes it possible to scale operations while maintaining quality and maximizing efficiency.\nConclusion: A Game-Changer for Cannabis Agriculture # The partnership between Dinaminica Generale and my farm has led to the creation of a revolutionary tool that has the potential to transform the cannabis industry.

This machine would not only revolutionize the way cannabis is harvested but also be a testament to my creativity and problem-solving skills. The goal was to design and build a harvester that could strip cannabis flowers from the stems of the plants efficiently and gently. The result would be a versatile, high-performing machine tailored specifically to the delicate needs of cannabis farming.\nThe project began with a partnership with Shelbourne, a highly respected manufacturer based in England, known for their expertise in custom agricultural equipment. They helped bring my vision to life by crafting an 8-foot right-hand auger header — the first and only one of its kind in the world. The auger header would serve as the key component for harvesting cannabis, as it would gently strip the flowers from the stems and pull the plant flowers and leaves into the machine, then using the auger to gently push the material on to a custom belt, that would move the material into a trailer. This step was crucial, as the flowers must be harvested without causing damage and brusing, which is a challenge when working with the fragile flower buds of cannabis plants.\nThe design of the auger header was carefully thought out to ensure that the harvesting process would be as efficient and gentle as possible. Traditional harvesting machines often damage the flowers, leading to wasted product and lower-quality yields. However, by customizing the header’s teeth and auger system, I was able to develop a solution that could delicately strip the flower buds while leaving the stems intact in the ground. This was a game-changer, as it allowed for the flowers to be moved onto the belt system without any unnecessary handling or stress, preserving their quality for further processing.\nOnce I had the header designed, I turned my attention to adapting it for use with a variety of loaders. The challenge was to create a versatile attachment system that would allow the auger header to be easily mounted onto any loader trackor, making the harvester adaptable to different environments and scales of production. I customized the attachment mechanism so that the header could be quickly and securely connected to various types of loaders, whether they were small, medium, or large-scale machines. This flexibility ensures that the harvester could be used for a wide range of applications, from small boutique farms to larger industrial operations.\nThe next step was integrating the auger header with a larger Bobcat tractor. I designed a custom bumper holder to attach the harvester to the tractor, making sure that everything was securely fastened and ready for action. To further enhance the functionality, I created an attachment plate specifically designed to connect the conveyor belt system to the auger header. This allowed the harvested cannabis flowers to be moved onto the belt, where they would then travel up into a dump trailer for easy transport. The entire setup was designed to create a continuous, seamless flow from harvesting to storage, ensuring that the system operated smoothly from start to finish.\nOne of the most crucial components of the design was the custom conveyor belt system. Cannabis flowers are delicate, and traditional harvesting methods often lead to damage or loss of product during transport. To avoid this, I added protective sides and bumpers around the belt, ensuring that the flowers would be moved safely without falling off or becoming damaged. The bumpers prevented the flowers from getting caught or jostled, while the sides kept the flowers securely on track as they were conveyed to the trailer.\nAnother important feature was the custom-designed teeth on the auger header. These teeth were carefully engineered to strip the flowers from the stems without causing any harm to the delicate buds. Traditional harvesting machines often fail to achieve this delicate balance, causing the flowers to be crushed or damaged during the stripping process. However, with the custom teeth, I was able to create a system that effectively separated the flowers from the stems, while keeping the buds intact and in top condition for processing. As the flowers were stripped from the plants, the auger would move them onto the conveyor belt, which would then transport them up into the dump trailer.\nThe custom cannabis harvester I designed is more than just a machine; it’s a solution to the specific challenges faced by cannabis cultivators. The versatility of the design allows the harvester to be used with different types of equipment, while the custom modifications ensure that the flowers are handled with care. From the specialized auger header to the adaptable loader attachment system, every aspect of the machine was designed with efficiency, gentleness, and ease of use in mind. This harvester is the perfect blend of innovative engineering and practical functionality, making it a game-changer for anyone looking to streamline their cannabis harvesting process.\nIn addition to its technical features, the harvester is a testament to the power of customization. By carefully considering every aspect of the machine’s design and tailoring it to meet the specific needs of cannabis cultivation, I was able to create a tool that is not only efficient but also perfectly suited to the unique challenges of the cannabis industry. From the initial concept to the final product, the project has been a labor of love, and I’m incredibly proud of the result. It’s a machine that combines cutting-edge technology with practical solutions, and it’s a true one-of-a-kind harvester that will make cannabis harvesting faster, easier, and more effective than ever before.\n","date":"14 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/organic_innovations/cannabis_harvester/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Cannnabis Harvaster","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"14 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/harvester/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Harvester","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/baler/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Baler","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 July 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/orkel/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Orkel","type":"tags"},{"content":" Story: Revolutionizing Hemp Farming with the Orkel Tracker Baler # In the ever-evolving world of hemp farming, innovation and efficiency are key to staying ahead. For one ambitious hemp farmer, the next leap forward came from an unexpected but game-changing collaboration with Orkel, a Norwegian company known for their innovative agricultural machinery. The farmer, already deeply immersed in the world of hemp cultivation, never anticipated that the next step in improving their operations would come from the introduction of a zero-oxygen baler—a revolutionary tool designed to enhance preservation and quality control in baled crops.\nThis is the story of how a unique partnership with Orkel and the introduction of their Orkel Tracker Baler, combined with a customized hemp program, changed the way they farmed hemp.\nA Chance Meeting with Orkel’s Owner # It all began when the owner of Orkel, a visionary figure in the agricultural machinery world, made a visit to the farmer’s property. Orkel is renowned for its cutting-edge baling technology, particularly their zero-oxygen balers, which were initially designed to preserve feed and forage by reducing the oxygen levels inside the bale, significantly extending the freshness and quality of the crop. With the hemp industry booming and the demand for high-quality, long-lasting products, the opportunity to incorporate this technology into hemp farming seemed like the perfect fit.\nOrkel’s baling machines were already used around the world in various agricultural sectors, but the farmer saw an opportunity to take it one step further. The idea was simple: adapt Orkel’s technology for hemp, where maintaining the crop’s quality post-harvest is essential for extracting potent cannabinoids and maintaining a premium product. The farmer had already been exploring ways to optimize their hemp production process, but this conversation would open a whole new realm of possibilities. During their visit, the Orkel owner and the farmer began discussing how the Orkel Tracker Baler—with its ability to drastically reduce oxygen within the bales—could be used to preserve the freshness of hemp biomass while it was in storage. By eliminating oxygen from the bale, the natural degradation process would be slowed down, helping the hemp to retain its potency and aroma, something critical for both CBD and THC-rich hemp. This technological advancement held the promise of dramatically improving the quality and shelf-life of hemp biomass, which in turn could lead to better product consistency in the end market.\nIntroducing Dinaminica Generale and the Hemp Program # But the collaboration didn’t end there. As the conversation progressed, the Orkel owner introduced the farmer to a unique piece of software called Dinaminica Generale. This sophisticated program was designed to work in conjunction with the Orkel Tracker Baler, providing a platform for data analytics and farm management. The system would allow the farmer to track important variables during the baling process, such as moisture levels, bale density, and temperature, all of which are critical when handling delicate crops like hemp.\nThe software could be integrated directly into the Orkel Tracker Baler, allowing for real-time adjustments and accurate monitoring. With this data, the farmer would have the ability to optimize their baling process to suit the specific needs of hemp, helping to ensure that the bales were compact, properly preserved, and perfectly suited for further processing. This was the kind of technology-driven approach the farmer had been seeking to elevate their hemp operation.\nThe introduction of Dinaminica Generale offered a clear advantage: not only could the farmer track the performance of each baler in real-time, but the software also provided predictive insights based on ongoing data. The farmer could now make informed decisions about harvesting, storage, and processing, significantly enhancing their overall efficiency.\nCustomizing the Baler for Hemp # As the discussions continued, the need for specialized equipment to cater specifically to the hemp industry became clear. While the Orkel Tracker Baler was a remarkable piece of machinery, the hemp industry has its own unique demands—particularly when it comes to processing and handling. The hemp plant is different from traditional forage crops like hay or alfalfa. Hemp stalks are thicker, and the flowers require careful handling to preserve their delicate properties.\nThis led to a more in-depth conversation about a custom-built solution—a baler that would be specifically designed for the hemp market. The farmer worked with Orkel’s engineers to explore the possibility of creating a smaller version of the Tracker Baler, one that could handle smaller-scale operations and be adaptable for different types of hemp crops.\nThis was where the concept of a frozen baler—a baler that could preserve the crop’s quality by freezing it at the point of baling—was introduced. Freezing hemp biomass immediately after harvest would lock in the cannabinoids and terpenes, ensuring the product was preserved in its prime state before being processed. This approach had not been used in the hemp industry before, and the farmer’s request for a custom frozen baler presented an exciting challenge for Orkel’s team.\nWorking together, the Orkel engineers and the farmer mapped out a plan for this unique baling solution. The key was in creating a mechanism that would not only bale the hemp efficiently but also incorporate freezing capabilities that could work within the baler itself. This custom baler would be able to adjust to the specific needs of the hemp industry, ensuring that the bales were preserved at peak quality and could be stored for longer periods without compromising the integrity of the biomass.\nThe vision was ambitious, but it became clear that this collaboration had the potential to revolutionize the way hemp farmers processed and stored their crops.\nThe Future of Hemp Farming: Efficiency and Quality Control # As the partnership between the farmer and Orkel continued to develop, it became evident that this technological innovation would play a pivotal role in the future of hemp farming. The combination of the Orkel Tracker Baler, the Dinaminica Generale software, and the custom hemp-specific modifications to the baler would not only improve the quality of the product but also streamline the entire harvesting and storage process.\nThe zero-oxygen baling technology, combined with the ability to freeze and preserve hemp, offered significant benefits for farmers seeking to maintain the potency and aroma of their crops while also maximizing efficiency. This approach could potentially increase profitability for farmers by ensuring that their hemp stayed fresh for longer periods, reducing waste and lowering the cost of processing. It was a solution that would be especially valuable for those growing hemp for CBD extraction or for the production of high-quality cannabinoids.\nBeyond the machinery itself, the collaboration signaled a broader trend in the industry: the push towards data-driven farming and the use of advanced technology to optimize crop management. By integrating precision farming techniques with custom-built equipment, farmers were given the tools they needed to increase both the quality and quantity of their yields.\nConclusion # What started as a simple conversation between the Orkel owner and a hemp farmer in need of better baling solutions has now evolved into a partnership that promises to redefine the future of hemp farming.

This ambitious project involved extensive planning, custom installations, and meticulous attention to detail to build a fully functional, high-tech facility capable of handling every step of the cannabis processing workflow — from initial cleaning to advanced separation techniques. The result is a fully equipped, laboratory designed for everything from winterization and distillation to butane extraction and chromatography.\nElectrical and Power Infrastructure: A Foundation for Precision\nThe backbone of my laboratory’s functionality began with the installation of a robust electrical system to support all the specialized equipment. I installed a dedicated 200-amp service to ensure the lab had more than enough power for everything from the heavy-duty extraction machines to the fine-tuned distillation apparatus. In addition to the 200-amp service, I incorporated a custom side inverter capable of providing 220V single-phase power, specifically for the Euro chiller required for certain processes like fresh frozen live extraction. This chiller, crucial for cooling solvents and ensuring optimal extraction, needed a dedicated power source to function at peak efficiency. The integration of these power systems not only supported the smooth operation of the laboratory but also ensured that each component had the necessary power to perform under demanding conditions from the heat to the cold.\nDesigning the Lab: Three Specialized Rooms for a Complete Workflow\nThe layout of the laboratory was designed with careful consideration for both efficiency and safety. I divided the lab into three distinct rooms, each dedicated to a specific stage of the cannabis extraction process. This division ensures a clean, organized workflow that minimizes contamination and maximizes the effectiveness of each stage. The lab begins with a wash and clean room, an essential first step in ensuring that all equipment, tools, and materials entering the lab are thoroughly sanitized before being exposed to sensitive extraction processes.\nThe clean room is equipped with an advanced filtration system, air purifiers, and drying equipment to ensure that the space remains sterile, preventing any contamination that could compromise the quality of the final product. Once everything is properly cleaned, it enters the main central room, which is the heart of the operation. This large, open space houses the more complex extraction and distillation equipment, including multiple rotary evaporators, winterising, short-path distiller, vacuum oven, and a flash chromatography setup — all critical tools for separating and refining the cannabis extracts.\nMain Central Room: Extraction, Distillation, and Separation\nIn the main center room, I set up the equipment for winterization and refinement. Winterization is an essential process for cannabis extraction, as it removes unwanted waxes and lipids from the extract. This is accomplished through the Euro chiller, which chills the extracted material to temperatures low enough to precipitate out these impurities. The rotary evaporators, three in total, allow for solvent removal, which is a crucial step in ensuring the final extract is pure and concentrated. The short-path distiller is used for further refining the distillate, purifying the cannabinoids to a high degree of potency.\nAdditionally, I’ve incorporated a vacuum oven into the setup, which serves multiple purposes, including solvent removal under controlled heat and vacuum, which prevents the degradation of delicate compounds. Flash chromatography is the final step in the separation process, ensuring that I can isolate specific cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds to create a variety of products, each with the desired properties. The integration of these tools into one room allows for a seamless, efficient workflow, making it easier to manage the distillation and refinement process in one centralized space.\nButane Extraction Room: Safety, Efficiency, and Precision\nThe next room in the lab is dedicated to butane extraction, which is commonly used for producing concentrates such as shatter, wax, and live resin. Since butane extraction involves volatile gases, safety was paramount when designing this room. I equipped the room with specialized explosion-proof fans and lights, ensuring that any potential sparks or heat sources are minimized. These precautions are essential for maintaining a safe working environment when dealing with flammable solvents.\nInside the extraction room, I installed a fully closed-loop butane extraction system that features chilled jackets, ensuring that the butane is kept at optimal temperatures throughout the process. This closed-loop system helps recover and recycle the butane, reducing waste and increasing the efficiency of the extraction process. The chilled jackets ensure that the extraction process remains at the ideal temperature for maximum yield and purity. The room is equipped with temperature and pressure sensors, which continuously monitor the extraction system to ensure everything is operating within safe and efficient parameters.\nCreating a Safe and Clean Environment\nEach room of the lab was built with safety and cleanliness in mind. The walls were constructed from stud framing, with drywall and durable finishes to maintain a sterile environment. The lab was carefully designed to meet all necessary codes and regulations, with features like fire suppression systems, chemical storage units, and emergency shutdown procedures to handle any unforeseen situations.\nThe sensors I installed in various areas of the lab are critical for monitoring environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and airflow. These sensors provide real-time data to ensure that the lab is operating under optimal conditions. If any parameter deviates from the desired range, the system triggers an alert, allowing me to take corrective action before it becomes an issue. Additionally, the fans and ventilation systems in each room are specifically tailored to control airflow and remove fumes, ensuring that the laboratory remains safe and efficient for workers.\nConclusion: A State-of-the-Art Cannabis Lab for Quality Extraction\nThe culmination of years of planning, research, and customization, this laboratory represents the next frontier in cannabis processing. The carefully designed layout, combined with the custom electrical systems, advanced extraction technologies, and safety measures, makes this facility a state-of-the-art operation for cannabis refinement. From the wash and clean room, through the main center room with its array of distillation and separation equipment, to the butane extraction room with its explosion-proof systems, every aspect of this lab was crafted with precision and care. This facility not only allows for high-quality cannabis extraction but also sets a new standard in terms of safety, efficiency, and innovation, and I’m proud to have created a one-of-a-kind laboratory capable of producing the finest cannabis concentrates on the market.\n","date":"8 May 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/organic_innovations/laboratory/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Laboratory","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cbd-hemp/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"CBD Hemp","type":"tags"},{"content":" ","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/organic_innovations/80acre_farm/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"CR.17.5 - 80 Acre Farm","type":"bio"},{"content":" ","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/organic_innovations/25898_cr17.5_farm/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Farm 25898 CR.17.5 Milliken, Colorado","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/greenhouses/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Greenhouses","type":"tags"},{"content":" Outdoor Hoops Design # Great Heater # Anti Smell Fans # Fogger # Bug Light # ","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/organic_innovations/greenhouse/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Greenhouses","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/oi/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"OI","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/organic-innovations/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Organic Innovations","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/rocket-farms/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Rocket Farms","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sd/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"SD","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/south-dakota-farm/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"South Dakota Farm","type":"tags"},{"content":" Hemp Dream Catcher # ","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/organic_innovations/south_dakota/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"South Dakota Farm","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/white-plume/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"White Plume","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 April 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/wonded-knee/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wonded Knee","type":"tags"},{"content":" Soil Mixer # Outdoor Seedling Sprayer # ","date":"8 February 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/organic_innovations/greenhouse/rocket_farms_ca/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Rocket Farms","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"1 February 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/plant-stripper/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Plant Stripper","type":"tags"},{"content":" ","date":"1 February 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/organic_innovations/plant_stripper/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Plant Stripper","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"6 January 2018","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/nikkal-farms/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Nikkal Farms","type":"tags"},{"content":"Farming with the Cliff\u0026rsquo;s was so great.

I had been working in agriculture for years, learning the ropes of sustainable farming, but I never imagined that one day I’d be leading a team at one of the premier dispensaries in downtown Fort Collins — Organic Alternatives. This dispensary, located in the heart of Colorado’s cannabis culture, was no ordinary operation. It was a high-end dispensary with an ambiance that blended old-world charm with modern sophistication, featuring a fancy, old bar-style display countertop that displayed some of the best organic cannabis in the area. As the only dispensary in downtown Fort Collins, it was at the forefront of the burgeoning cannabis industry, and I had just been offered the position of Head Cultivation Manager. It was a dream job that would fast-track my knowledge and experience in the cannabis industry in ways I could never have imagined.\nThe Call That Changed Everything # I had been working in agriculture, focused on traditional crops and small-scale growing operations, but my passion for plant cultivation — particularly cannabis —. The owner at Organic Alternatives suggested I come look at the job for the position of Head Cultivation Manager, telling me that they are in need of someone who could help ramp up production. The job seemed like a perfect fit, but I had no idea what it would entail.\nThey shared their vision for the business, from the fancy in-house bar-style display to the incredible different strains of organic cannabis they were offering. This wasn’t just any dispensary — Organic Alternatives was focused on delivering high-quality, premium cannabis to its customers. The dispensary prided itself on having high-end, organic cannabis that was grown with care, and it catered to a sophisticated clientele who appreciated the unique flavors and therapeutic properties of the plants.\nDespite my experience in agriculture, I was known for the best garder around. With years of quanity.\nGetting Started: A Crash Course in Cannabis Cultivation # From the moment I stepped into the cultivation facility, I realized I was about to embark on a journey unlike any I had experienced. The dispensary’s growing operation was located in a large warehouse just outside downtown, and it was a beehive of activity. I was now in charge of the grow department, overseeing everything from seed to harvest. The team I inherited was a passionate, driven group, but there were challenges ahead. The goal was clear: increase production. Organic Alternatives had been producing around 330 pounds of cannabis per year, but they didnt know that i could get them to a number of 1,500 pounds in just one year. With every strin over 20% THC and some as high as 32% THC. We harvest every 16 days with a 16 day plant move at 84 harvest a year.\nI optimized the growing conditions, and building problems with the best techniques for maximizing yields without sacrificing quality. The facility operated with fully tracked state systems that monitored every step of the process, from planting to waste disposal. I learned about the complex systems for tracking plants and waste — an essential part of maintaining compliance with the state’s cannabis regulations and fire department.\nIn addition to learning about cannabis genetics and cultivation practices, I quickly had to dive deep into pest management, fungi, bacteria, and other common agricultural challenges. The cannabis plant is particularly sensitive to environmental changes. I became a fast learner when it came to identifying the signs of bacterial infections, fungal growth, or insect damage, and I put together a robust preventative strategy for all the plants under my care. I was constantly experimenting with new techniques and staying up to date on the latest agricultural research.\nBuilding a Team and Boosting Production # At the same time, I was building a team. Organic Alternatives was growing fast, and we needed to expand our operations. I walked into a team of growers, each with their own strengths and expertise, and we worked together to streamline the cultivation process. We also established a hand trimmer harvest team, a joint roller team, and a packing team, each responsible for a specific part of the operation.\nOur goal was to deliver a product that not only met the high standards of Organic Alternatives but exceeded them. One of the key aspects of our operation was ensuring the quality of every product, from the flowers to the concentrates. The dispensary prided itself on offering 54 different flavors of cannabis — each with its own distinct aroma, taste, and therapeutic effects. Our flower was top-tier, and the joints we hand-rolled were designed to reflect the same quality. We also produced high-quality butane oil concentrates that were sold for premium prices, with some grams retailing at $60. The quality control and attention to detail that went into every product were paramount.\nThrough constant monitoring, refinement, and careful cultivation techniques, we started seeing results. Within the first few months, I had already boosted production significantly, but it was a marathon, not a sprint. By the end of the year, we had surpassed our initial goal. Production had grown from 330 pounds to 1,500 pounds, and the quality remained impeccable. We were now producing a steady stream of high-quality cannabis that was sold out almost immediately.\nThe Green Rush: A Thriving Industry in Full Swing # As our production increased, so did the demand. The Green Rush was in full swing in Colorado, and people were flocking from all over the United States to experience the legal, regulated cannabis market. Downtown Fort Collins, with its charm and vibrant atmosphere, became a hub for cannabis enthusiasts. Organic Alternatives became a go-to destination for high-end cannabis products, and people lined up to purchase our premium flowers, joints, and concentrates. We were now selling our 1/8 oz packages at $60, which reflected the high-end nature of our offerings.\nThe success of Organic Alternatives was a combination of several factors: our commitment to quality, our unique selection of 54 different cannabis strains, and our ability to scale up production without compromising on the product.

The combination of hard work, dedication, and a bit of luck allowed us to thrive during the early years of Colorado’s cannabis market.\nReflection: A Career Transformed # Looking back, my time at Organic Alternatives was a period of immense growth — both professionally and personally. The job fast-tracked my knowledge of cannabis agriculture, allowing me to learn about pests, fungi, bacteria, and plant health in ways that I had never encountered before. I had the unique opportunity to not only run a cultivation facility but to help guide a team of talented individuals who shared my passion for cannabis.\nAt the end of the day, the success of Organic Alternatives wasn’t just about the numbers. It was about the people, the dedication to quality, and the knowledge we built together. What started as a simple job offer turned into a life-changing opportunity that allowed me to contribute to the cannabis industry in ways that will last a lifetime. Organic Alternatives was more than just a dispensary to me — it was the place where my passion for cannabis cultivation truly took root, and where I learned what it truly takes to succeed in the rapidly changing cannabis world.\n","date":"20 April 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/organic_alternative/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Organic Alternatives","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"20 April 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/gardening/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Gardening","type":"tags"},{"content":" Biography: From Backyard Garden to Heirloom Farming – The Organic Journey Begins # Introduction # The story of how the love for organic farming blossomed is deeply rooted in a small, humble backyard—one that began as a place to experiment and learn, but eventually grew into something much larger. It was here that the journey began for the founder, who, driven by a passion for sustainable agriculture, transformed a simple garden into a space dedicated to growing a wide range of heirloom vegetables. This backyard hoop-house became the foundation of a lifelong love affair with organic farming. Over time, this passion would evolve into a career that sought to promote healthier food systems, showcase the beauty of heirloom varieties, and foster a deeper connection with nature.\nThe Backyard Hoop-House: A Dream in the Making # Like many who venture into farming, the founder’s journey began with a desire to reconnect with the earth and cultivate food in a way that was sustainable and nourishing. With no formal training in agriculture, they started small. A homemade greenhouse—or hoop-house—was the first step in this journey, built with the intention of creating a controlled environment for year-round growing.\nThis backyard space, though modest, became a sanctuary where the founder could experiment and learn firsthand the complexities of growing plants. The homemade greenhouse was simple yet effective: constructed with materials like PVC pipes and plastic sheeting, it was designed to extend the growing season and provide protection from the elements. Despite its humble beginnings, the hoop-house was soon filled with an array of crops that would set the foundation for everything to come.\nIt was in this small space that the founder began to learn the intricacies of soil health, plant care, and seasonal growing cycles. They discovered the joy of planting seeds, nurturing them through the growing process, and watching them thrive. This experience ignited a lifelong passion for growing food organically, setting the stage for the larger farm projects that would come later.\nA Diverse Collection: Growing 128 Heirloom Varieties # While many gardeners start with a few simple varieties, the founder’s love for heirloom vegetables quickly took root. They were captivated by the diverse range of colors, flavors, and histories behind each variety. Heirloom vegetables are open-pollinated varieties passed down through generations, often treasured for their rich taste and genetic diversity. The founder decided to cultivate a wide assortment of heirloom crops, and in the process, they learned the value of preserving these unique plants.\nIn the hoop-house, the founder grew 128 different heirloom varieties of vegetables, each with its own story and characteristics. This impressive diversity ranged from vibrant heirloom tomatoes in various shades of red, yellow, and orange, to rare greens, colorful carrots, and a plethora of beans, squash, and peppers. The garden became a living testament to the beauty and variety that organic, sustainable farming could offer.\nGrowing these heirloom varieties also meant that the founder had to take extra care in maintaining the genetic integrity of the plants. Each variety was treated with the utmost respect, as many heirlooms are considered precious for their ability to adapt to local environments and for their rich flavors, which are often absent in modern commercial crops. The founder took pride in not just growing these plants, but in preserving the history and culture behind them.\nThe organic methods used in the backyard garden reflected a commitment to sustainability. The founder avoided using synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, or herbicides, instead relying on natural alternatives to promote healthy plant growth. They worked with the land to improve soil fertility, using techniques such as composting and crop rotation, which helped keep the soil healthy and free of disease. These practices, learned through experimentation and research, became the core principles of the founder’s farming philosophy.\nLearning the Ropes: Challenges and Growth # Growing such a wide variety of vegetables, especially heirlooms, presented its own set of challenges. Each plant had its own specific needs, requiring a different approach to care. The founder learned the importance of understanding each crop’s unique characteristics—whether it was the amount of sunlight it required, the soil conditions it thrived in, or the best methods for preventing pests and diseases. There were moments of failure, when crops didn’t yield as expected, or pests damaged entire sections of the garden. However, each failure provided an invaluable lesson and a stepping stone to improvement.\nOne of the biggest challenges was managing the diversity of plants while also balancing the care of the soil. With 128 different varieties, crop rotation and soil management became critical to preventing depletion of nutrients and the buildup of pests or disease. The founder learned to adapt, adjusting planting schedules, experimenting with different growing techniques, and using organic pest control measures like companion planting and natural repellents.\nThroughout this process, the founder not only gained practical farming knowledge but also developed a deep respect for the natural world. They came to understand how all aspects of farming—soil health, plant diversity, water conservation, and pest management—are interconnected and vital for a thriving ecosystem. It was clear that farming organically was not just about avoiding chemicals, but about fostering a healthy, balanced environment for both plants and people.\nA Growing Passion for Organics # The experience of growing heirloom vegetables in the homemade greenhouse planted the seed for a lifelong commitment to organic farming. The founder’s appreciation for organics grew exponentially as they saw firsthand the benefits of using natural methods. They found that the food grown in their backyard hoop-house was not only more flavorful and nutritious but also had a deeper connection to the land it came from. Every vegetable harvested felt like a victory, a result of hard work, patience, and an unwavering belief in the power of organic farming.\nThis love of organics didn’t stop at farming—it extended to the broader belief system that the foundation of agriculture should be built on principles of sustainability, biodiversity, and respect for nature. The founder understood that organic farming wasn’t just about avoiding chemicals, but about improving the health of the land and providing healthier, more nutrient-dense food for people.\nAs the years passed and the backyard garden grew into something larger, the founder’s commitment to organics deepened. The lessons learned in the hoop-house would go on to shape their approach to larger-scale farming, guiding them as they ventured into more professional farming projects and, eventually, the world of cannabis cultivation and other ventures. However, it all started in that humble backyard garden with the simple but profound act of planting seeds and nurturing them to life.\nLegacy and Impact # The founder’s journey in organic farming has left a lasting legacy, not just in their own work, but in the broader movement toward sustainable agriculture. By starting small and learning through hands-on experience, they’ve proven that anyone can grow healthy, nutrient-rich food, even in the smallest of spaces. Their love for heirloom vegetables and organic farming has inspired others to explore sustainable growing practices and has contributed to the growing awareness of the importance of local, organic food systems.\nWhile the backyard hoop-house was just the beginning, it served as the launchpad for a career built on a passion for farming, sustainability, and education. The founder’s work with heirloom varieties, their commitment to preserving genetic diversity, and their advocacy for organic farming have not only contributed to the success of their own ventures but have also helped shape the organic farming community in their region. What began as a personal passion for organics continues to influence their work and inspire others to embrace sustainable, organic practices in their own lives.\nThrough their journey, the founder has shown that organic farming, no matter how small, has the potential to transform lives, communities, and the planet. From the backyard hoop-house to larger-scale farming operations, their love for growing has always been rooted in a deep respect for nature and a commitment to feeding the world in a way that nurtures both the land and its people.\n","date":"20 April 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/gardening/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Gardening","type":"bio"},{"content":"","date":"20 April 2006","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/vegetables/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vegetables","type":"tags"},{"content":"Alfa Grease SOP\nWeight of pot in Grams\n12galx 3,785g = 45,420gram water for big pot with 1000grams alfa 150F hold for 20-30mins 283F hold for 1 hour Cold to 90F\n38,250grams - Alfa Extract X 1.15 = 15% 43,987.5 - Total Weight\n43,987g\n38,250g = 5,737g Ethanol (– Grease Gram After for total) x.25 1,434g Grease (-) Grease Grams from Ethanol Grams\nStir and Bottle\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/fractal_growth/grease/alfa_grease/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Alfa Grease","type":"bio"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/alfalfa-extract/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Alfalfa Extract","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/fractal_growth/grease/amber_grease/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Amber Grease","type":"bio"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/apples/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Apples","type":"tags"},{"content":" ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/gardening/apples/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Apples","type":"bio"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/basil/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Basil","type":"tags"},{"content":" ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/gardening/basil/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Basil","type":"bio"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/beans/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Beans","type":"tags"},{"content":"Dried Blackbean Half white half black bean ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bio/gardening/beans/","section":"Biography","summary":"","title":"Beans","type":"bio"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/beekeeping/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"BeeKeeping","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/bees/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Bees","type":"tags"},{"content":" Boxes: # Care: # Use Your Eyes!
